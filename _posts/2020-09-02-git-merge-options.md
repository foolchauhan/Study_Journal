<h3>Git Merge Strategies</h3>
<p>
    A merge happens when combining two branches. Git will take two (or more) commit pointers and attempt to find a common base commit between them. 
    Git has several different methods to find a base commit, these methods are called "merge strategies". <br>
    Once Git finds a common base commit it will create a new "merge commit" that combines the changes of the specified merge commits. Technically, a merge commit is a regular commit which just happens to have two parent commits.
